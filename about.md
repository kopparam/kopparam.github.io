Summary
-------
Lead Engineer, with over 6 years of experience in software development for applications of scale and quality, across various technologies. I enjoy finding value stream bottlenecks in the practice of engineering to enable rapid business changes and experimentation and gaining expertise in different technologies quickly to provide value across the board. I am looking forward to practicing DevOps transformations and product development in an organization with a successful business, technical excellence and a healthy culture.
